# Front-end Skeleton

## Introduction
The intention of this skeleton is to give a base platform for you to build your project on top of.

All build tools are supplied through Node. The skeletons primary focus for tooling is via Gulp, however, support for Grunt is included where applicable.

It is a collection of build tools, configuration files, folder structures and more. Below are some of the features provided:

- Compile and prefix style sheets from SASS.
- Bundle and uglify JavaScript source files into payloads.
- Compile template files into JavaScript.
- Lint source files to ensure standards and conformance.
- Perform testing via a test runner and test suite.
- Watch source files and trigger compilation as required.
- Optimize image assets of various formats.
- Convenience methods for building front-end style sheets and scripts.

## Installation
All tooling dependencies are node based, and can be installed by running the appropriate `Makefile` method:

```
make fe-setup;
```

This will ensure the dependencies are installed and that the build files are compiled and ready for usage. For the SASS compilation you will also need the Ruby gem `sass` which can be installed with the following command:

```
gem install sass;
```

## Folder Structure
Both style sheets and scripts follow the same structure. Library files are placed in `libs`. These library files do not have to be minifed and in best practice probably shouldn't be. This is because during development, errors within them are easier to debug, and also that the build scripts will be minifying them anyway.

All source files are placed within `src` and are split into modular files to aid in decoupling and organisation. Build files that are the end result of compilation are placed within the root of the `css` or `js` folders.

JavaScript test files are places within `js/tests` and should have the suffix `.spec.js` so they're picked up by the test runner.

Images are placed within an `img` folder and should be maintained by grouping related imagery (features, sections etc..) into sub-folders.

Fonts reside within `fonts` and normally should be grouped into sub-folders that can house all of the different formats per font family.

Build tool methods are stored within `run` to encapsulate them away from project source files. They are split into folders per method, with each folder containing `gulp` and `grunt` versions along with an additional file (`_common.js`) which us used to share settings.

## Settings and Configuration
There are a multitude of settings files included in the root of the repository.

`.gitignore` offers a collection of common files and folders that should be removed from source control, as well as some custom files generated by the tooling of this skeleton.

`.jshintignore` and `.jshintrc` are used in conjunction with the linting tool and can be used to customise the standards and rules which the JavaScript source code must adhere to.

`.editorconfig` is a configuration file for [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/); a plugin / package that can be installed in most popular editors. It enforces all team members to use the same formatting settings such as spaces over tabs, line endings and so on.

`karma.conf.js` houses configuation for [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/). It can also contain settings for Mocha, Chai and Sinon.
